# Adaptive-Resource-Allocation-System-ARAS
ARAS is a sophisticated, concurrent project management system designed to simulate and manage complex projects with intricate resource allocation, task dependencies, and potential failure points
## Overview

**ARAS** is a sophisticated, concurrent project management system designed to simulate and manage complex projects with intricate resource allocation, task dependencies, and potential failure points. Built using modern C++, **ARAS** leverages advanced features like multithreading, synchronization primitives, and an event-driven architecture to provide a robust and insightful model of real-world project execution.

## Features

*   **Concurrent Project Execution:** Utilizes multithreading to run multiple projects simultaneously, maximizing resource utilization and simulating real-world scenarios.
*   **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Implements a priority queue to ensure that high-priority projects are executed first.
*   **Resource Management:**  Manages tools and materials efficiently, allocating them to projects based on blueprint requirements.
*   **Adaptable Tools:** Tools can be adapted with specific parameters, providing flexibility in project execution.
*   **Detailed Blueprints:** Blueprints define project requirements, including tools, materials, and execution logic.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to catch and manage potential issues like resource shortages, tool malfunctions, and unexpected project failures.
*   **Event-Driven System:** A rudimentary event system allows listeners to react to project events like enqueueing, starting, completing, or failing.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive logging provides insights into project execution, resource allocation, and error occurrences.
*   **Customizable Execution Logic:** Projects can have unique execution logic defined through lambda functions, allowing for a wide range of simulated scenarios.

## Building and Running

To compile ARAS, use g++ or the provided Makefile.

```bash
make
# or
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -pthread -o aras
```

Run the program after compilation:

```bash
./aras
```

## How It Works
Project objects encapsulate everything needed to complete a task (blueprint, status, and priority).
Blueprint objects describe which tools and materials you need, along with the specific logic to execute (such as welding, painting, or 3D printing).
ProjectManager maintains a std::priority_queue of pending projects. A background thread monitors this queue:
Pulls the highest-priority project.
Executes it, from resource acquisition to blueprint logic.
Triggers event listeners when the project starts, completes, or fails.
If concurrency is your labyrinth, the code’s condition variables and thread synchronization will be your best (or worst) friend.

## Future Directions
Network Integration: Expose an API to enqueue projects remotely—an Arcane Foundry in the cloud, if you will.

Dependency Graphs: Let projects depend on the outputs of prior tasks, weaving a grand tapestry of interconnected steps.

Advanced Tool Calibration: Extend the adapt(...) logic to handle real-world sensor feedback, dynamically adjusting weld temperatures or print layer thickness.

## Thinking about it

Observations and Potential Growth Areas
Concurrency as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
Right now, a single background worker thread processes the queue. That’s entirely valid for demonstration purposes, but if your pipeline needs heavier parallelization, you can expand your concurrency model:

Spin up multiple workers or threads that each draw from the priority queue.
Implement a thread pool, ensuring you don’t spin more threads than your CPU can effectively handle.
Resource Competition vs. Resource Allocation
Currently, each project “checks out” the resources it needs by calling consume or adapt on them. If you wanted to represent a scenario where multiple concurrent projects share the same resource pool, you might create a dedicated resource manager that enforces:

Atomic Resource Deduction: Lock or use transactional updates to ensure multiple projects don’t overshoot available materials.
Wait Conditions: If a project’s needed materials aren’t available yet (e.g., they’re being replenished or locked by another project), you could move it into a waiting state, or re-queue it.
Blueprint Logic as a Plugin System
The usage of std::function<void(Project&)> is flexible. You might turn “execution logic” into a plugin architecture, where more specialized functions (like calibrating scanning tools or controlling robotic arms) can be loaded at runtime. This separates your main code from the domain-specific steps, so your project manager is purely orchestration logic, and specialized tasks live in a different module.

Dynamic Adaptation & Failure Recovery

Tools can “break” (e.g., breakdown() sets operational_ to false), but your system currently just aborts the project. You could implement an automated fallback or “repair” strategy.
For instance, if the Welder-01 breaks, the system might look for an alternate welder or queue a “RepairProject” that replenishes or fixes the broken tool before re-attempting the original project.
Extended Event System
The existing event listener shows an elegant way to keep external observers in the loop—like logging or a hypothetical GUI. If you wanted deeper event reporting:

Add fine-grained events: TOOL_ADAPTED, MATERIAL_CONSUMED, etc.
Provide a queue or broadcast mechanism for user interfaces or other services to subscribe.
Logging & Diagnostics
For production-grade expansions, you might unify your messages under a logging library (like spdlog, Boost.Log, or a custom logger) with configurable severity levels. This ensures you can gather full trace info if something goes awry and remain silent if you’re running in “quiet” mode.

Stateless vs. Stateful Execution
In your execution logic lambdas, you rely on the captured environment (e.g., references to materials). That’s straightforward for demonstration but consider a scenario where these lambdas are stored or serialized for later. In such cases, you’d want them to be as stateless as possible, referencing materials by ID or via a resource manager.

Versioning & Branches
You could maintain multiple branches:

Stable Branch: A minimal concurrency version (fewer moving parts, simpler to test).
Experimental Branch: For advanced features (like multi-thread concurrency, complex dependency graphs).
This fosters a cleaner structure for potential collaborators and helps you track new features with fewer collisions.
Using This Architecture for Other Projects
Game Inventory System

Instead of “Projects,” think “quests” or “crafting tasks.”
Tools become “weapons” or “crafting stations,” materials become “resources” (iron ore, gemstones, etc.).
The concurrency piece might handle multiple asynchronous in-game crafting tasks, each requiring resources or a workstation with parameters.
Workflow in IoT Environments

“Projects” are device orchestration tasks, such as calibrating sensors or adjusting robotics in an automated factory floor.
“Materials” might be energy, CPU cycles, or time slots on a shared sensor array.
“Tools” are IoT devices, each with parameters (IP addresses, protocols, calibration settings).
Data Processing Pipeline

Each “Project” could be a data-transformation job, requiring specific data sets or “materials” (like CSV files).
“Tools” might be specialized libraries (machine learning models, parsers, formatters) that you “adapt” (configure hyperparameters, file paths).
The concurrency ensures the highest priority data transformations happen first, with event listeners hooking into logging or real-time dashboards.
Scriptable Build System

Instead of a single concurrency approach, the blueprint logic might compile code, run tests, or deploy artifacts.
Tools become compilers, linkers, or testers. Materials become code packages, Docker images, or environment variables.
Event listeners could send Slack notifications or emails on build completion/failure.
Academic/Research Simulations

Projects might represent experiments in computational biology, each requiring certain CPU/GPU resources (tools) and input data sets (materials).
The concurrency layer can handle queueing of experiments with different priorities (urgent HPC tasks vs. background analyses).
